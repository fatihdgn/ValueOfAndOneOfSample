# ValueOfAndOneOfSample

This is a sample project where I tried to use [ValueOf](https://github.com/mcintyre321/ValueOf), [OneOf](https://github.com/mcintyre321/OneOf) and [LanguageExt.Core](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext) packages.
The app flow is simple; it is asking the user for an input from console, validates the input, and prints it back to the console.
